# bike-ridership-nn
Simple implementation of a neural network using only Numpy and Pandas, used to predict bike ridership data. This project was developed as part of the great [Deep Learning Nanodegree Foundations by Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree-foundation--nd101).

## What you'll need
The whole point of this project is to get our hands dirty by implementing a neural network just with the basics. So, you'll only need:

* Python 3.
* Pandas.
* Numpy.
* Matplotlib.

You can install these tools by running this handy command :)

`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

Finally, all the details are [here](https://github.com/jesus-a-martinez-v/bike-ridership-nn/blob/master/neural-network.ipynb). Feel free to tweak, poke and experiment as much as you want!
